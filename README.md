<h1>Bitcoin Prediction Dataset</h1>
<p>This study reports closing price data set of the historical Bitcoin utilizing analysis
techniques of time series to examine foundation features, define the data set
seasonality, trend and cyclic components. The aim is to design appropriate models for
anticipating future prices, regression analysis of performance with dummy variables
quarterly and daily, and create forecast for 5, 10, and 30months periods to the most
accurate model. Approaches like moving average method, random walk model, additive and multiplicative model with quarterly and daily dummy variable, the ratio- moving average method were applied to improve anticipating accuracy.</p>

<p>The following findings were identified through this research: a sustained long-term rising
pattern was revealed in Bitcoin prices, which reflect increasing adoption and market
growth. In terms of seasonality, repeating and regular short-term trends were examined, may probably be boosted by behavioral cycles and external market events. Concerning
cyclic variations, major market shifts are aligned with wider price cycles which indicate
sensitivity to regulatory changes and macroeconomics. Regarding regression analysis, quarterly and daily dummy variables indicated not significant seasonal effects, however,
in intercept and date where price behavior deviated from baseline expectations. With
regard to residual analysis, minimal autocorrelation was a basis for residuals which
validates the selected model robustness. In regard with forecasts, random walk model
and additive models with daily dummy were used to occur accurate predictions for 5, 10, and 30 periods.</p>

<p>This research paper recommends to use the predicted Bitcoin price patterns to give
information about strategic investment decisions. Furthermore, to reinforce anticipating
accuracy, models of additive model and random walk model were used. Additionally, considering external shocks, policy charges and volatility of the market are reassessed
consistently. Overall, this final paper stresses the effectiveness of time series method in identifying
and anticipating Bitcoin price alterations. By enhancing improved analytics and develop
models, participants can decide data analysis in a volatile cryptocurrency market</p>
